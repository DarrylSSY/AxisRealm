#                  Welcome to ChatControl's Chat Formatting Configuration
#
#   In this configuration you can setup how the message in the chat should look like.
# 
#   Since we support different message formats per different permissions,
#   per channels, or many other places in the plugin, you can create a so-called
#   formats that can be reused multiple times.
#
#   For configuration, see:
#   - https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Pro/wiki/Formats
#
#   For variables, see:
#   - https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Pro/wiki/Variables
#
#   Remember, you can remove or edit all formats below, and create your own ones!

# Here are the actual formats. A format represents how a message should look like.
# Each format consists of Parts (each part is configured individually).
#
# You can re-use them in different parts of the plugin, for example in chat channels.
#
# For tutorial, see https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Pro/wiki/Formats
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Formats:
  #
  # This is the default main chat format.
  #
  # You can use it in other parts of the plugin by calling the 'Chat' format.
  #
  Chat: 
    #
    # This is a part. That means, we split the message into as many parts
    # as you'd like, giving each part different interactive properties.
    #
    # Options such as Sender_Permission or Hover_Event are not obligatory, you can remove
    # them or add them at your will. For tutorial and all available options, see the link above.
