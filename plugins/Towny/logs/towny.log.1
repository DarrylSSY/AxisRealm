[Jul 13, 2018 12:17:17 AM] Essentials detected: The Towny authors would like to make you
[Jul 13, 2018 12:17:17 AM] aware that Essentials has been causing town and nation bank
[Jul 13, 2018 12:17:17 AM] accounts to reset. Furthermore their handling of bank accounts
[Jul 13, 2018 12:17:17 AM] has left vital town, nation, warchest and server accounts
[Jul 13, 2018 12:17:17 AM] vulnerable to exploitation. Towny has made changes to stop
[Jul 13, 2018 12:17:17 AM] these exploits from occuring but we cannot stop Essentials
[Jul 13, 2018 12:17:17 AM] Economy from reseting bank accounts. Please change to another
[Jul 13, 2018 12:17:17 AM] Essentials-type plugin as soon as you are able.
