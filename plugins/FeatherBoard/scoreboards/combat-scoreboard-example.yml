  # This is a combat scoreboard example showing
  # Combat related information.
  # DO NOT GIVE THE PERMISSION FOR THIS SCOREBOARD
  # (Unless you want it to show all the time)
  # You still need to 'trigger' this scoreboard in the vanilla_combat

  # Lets just use the title,header and footer from the default example
  # for in depth configuration look at the default.yml
  #
  # When designing a board that is used when triggered on an event. You have
  # to think (before looking at the placeholders) what is relevant.
  # For example: When I think of combat my first thoughts are:
  # - Health: To see how much you have left
  # - Possible cooldown timers
  # - With who am I in combat?
  # - Target health
  # - mcMMO attacking level?
  #
  # Next you have to think what is important during that event:
  # - Combat: not too much distraction (no animations, smaller scoreboard)
  #
  # Once you know those things start looking for placeholders. A lot of events such
  # as mcmmo have placeholders that can only be used in such events.
